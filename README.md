# Teeth Segmentation and Counting in Panoramic X-ray Images

This project demonstrates teeth segmentation and counting in panoramic X-ray images using a Mask R-CNN model. The application is built with Streamlit for a user-friendly web interface and utilizes various libraries such as Plotly, OpenCV, and PIL for image processing and visualization.

## Features

- **Teeth Segmentation**: Detects and segments teeth in panoramic X-ray images.
- **Caries Detection**: Identifies and counts the number of caries (cavities) in the detected teeth.
- **Missing Teeth Calculation**: Calculates the number of missing teeth based on a full set of 32 teeth.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Provides an interactive visualization of the original image and the segmentation results using Plotly.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
